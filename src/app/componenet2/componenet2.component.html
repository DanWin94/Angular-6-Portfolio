    <div><span style="color: #000000; text-align: left; font-size: 20px">Hello there! My name is Danny Nguyen. I am a software developer that is currently residing in Atlanta, Georgia, As someone who likes to solve problems, I have always been fascinated with coding since I was a senior in highschool. I graduated from Georgia State University in 2019 with a bachelors of science in computer science and with a concentration in databases. I mainly enjoy UX/UI design and web development. As of right now, I am currently employed as a application developer at United Paracel Services or commonly known as UPS. When I am not working, I like to take pictures with my camera or go hiking with friends. Some of my other interest include keeping up with new Javascript frameworks( I am currently keeping up with Angular 8 and ReactJS) and practiceing my coding skills. I think when you open up your mind to new concepts , you are allowing yourself to fully embrace the ever changing world. You can check out my resume and more on what I know in the experience tab!</span></div>
